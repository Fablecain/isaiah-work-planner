# ISAIAH-WORK-PLANNER

## Motivation
- In today's fast-paced world, staying organized is key to being effective in one's profession. The motivation behind this project was to create an intuitive and accessible tool for employees to manage their time.
- The work planner provides an easy-to-use interface for busy employees to keep track of their tasks.
- This application allows users to set tasks for each hour of the standard 9am-5pm workday. 
- Building this project deepened my understanding of DOM manipulation using jQuery.
